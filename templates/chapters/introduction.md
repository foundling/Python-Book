# Aim of This Guide

If you are new to programming or want to try it out but aren't really sure what it's all about, then this book is for you.  I'm going to build your fundamental skills and teach you how to use these skills to solve problems that you find interesting. 

I like to ask myself questions, so here goes a few:

**Q: With so many introductory books out there, why have you written another one?** 


For one, I'm a bit of a text-book addict, and I've come to realize that many of the introductory books I've read make assumptions about their audience's background that end up limiting the transmission of the knowledge, skills and wisdom that they contain. Or they assume that the student is not helped by theory at all and awkardly attempt to avoid it, referencing it in only a passing way. In the former sort of book, there's often a disclaimer stating something like 'the shouldn't should have taken a first course in calculus', substituting discrete math, statistics, trigonometry, etc. For the student who suffered through these topics in the not-so-recent past or not at all, this is a closed door.  And the latter type of book, while very useful, doesn't build the necessary skills to write programs smartly.

I owe a lot to both sorts of books and other than those books which are just bad, I have no qualms with them per se.  I am simply trying to write a book for the people in the middle: programmers who want to learn some theory from programming and how to program better from theory.

I will endeavor to show that theory is actually practical and that practicality can be achieved out of theory, but in a way that constantly emphasizes the question 'why?'.  In the process, I won't avoid diving into the things that new programmers need to know, things that make programming *make more sense*, like how to read a program effectively, how to structure a program, how to debug a program. 

**Q: And why does this book use Python?**

The commonplace line about Python is that it's a good beginner language.  This is true: Python code can be written with a more natural language-like syntax, which makes it easier to read. The syntax is minimal. It has a lot of useful built-in functions and useful 3rd party libraries. But I also think it makes for a great first language because of the wisdom in the design.
