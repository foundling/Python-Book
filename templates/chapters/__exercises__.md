# Filtering Usernames 

For the following exercises, we are going to create a sub-list of usernames that satisfy a given criterion. 

Here's the list:

    usernames = ['redsoxfan9000', 'djcarlos', 'donutman', '?uestlove', 'bbgun', 'rjd2c3po', 'videogamez', 'lilly99']

Hint: you will find the for loop construct useful here, as well as a previously defined variable that will hold temporary data during the loop. 

# Ex. 1 - Six or Shorter

Go through the items in `usernames` and pick out the usernames that are 6 or less characters long. Put them in a new list and print that list.

# Ex. 2 - Seven or Longer

Do the same as you did in the previous exercise, but only print out the usernames that are greater than 6 characters long.

# Ex. 3 - Total Characters

Find the total number of characters that the list of usernames contains

# Ex. 4 - Total Unique Characters

Find the total number of *unique* characters that the list of usernames contains

# Ex. 5 - Most Numbers in Username

Find the username(s) that contain the most numbers 

# Ex. 6 - Find the shortest username

# Ex. 7 - Find the Longest username
